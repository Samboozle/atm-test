**This site was built for assessment by ATM.com. Thanks in advance!**

  I developed it in a Node V14.5.0 environment. It uses
  - Gatsby
  - Gatsby minimal starter (```gatsby new```)
  - gatsby-image and its dependencies for some image handling
  - PostCSS for styling

**To launch**

  Assuming you have npm installed...

    git clone https://github.com/Samboozle/atm-test.git
    cd atm-test
    npm install
  
  and either (development)
    
    npm run develop

  or (production)

    npm run build
    npm run serve


**What I learned**

  This was my first project in gatsby as well as my first exposure to graphql! I also got to write some (admittedly sloppy) css with PostCSS for the first time.

**What it still needs**

  - Most of the content
  - Stylesheet refactoring
  - Tests!
